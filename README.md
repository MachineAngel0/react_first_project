# First React/Java Project

This is my first attempt at anything webdev related. 
I have experience in primarly c++ with OpenGL and game dev with Unreal Engine
I've also made a few python scripts to speed up my personal workflows.

Overall, there were alot of concepts that were very new to me, 
as this web dev project dealt with a lot of API and networking concepts

This project has made me really appreciate what goes on within web development and what it takes to get 
something up and running
